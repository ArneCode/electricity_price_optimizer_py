"""Transactional in-memory map with commit/rollback semantics.

Intended for simple unit-of-work style staging:
- set/delete operations are staged until commit
- rollback clears staged changes
- get reflects staged updates and hides staged deletions

Not thread/multiprocess safe. Use a proper transactional store for multithreaded applications.
